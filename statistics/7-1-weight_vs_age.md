[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

The scatterplot suggests a weak correlation between mother's age and birth weight.
Pearson's correlation is .0688
Spearman's correlation is .0946

I would characterize these variables as having no significant relationship.
